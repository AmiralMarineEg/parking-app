# parking-app

My first Flutter-based project. App (Android and iOS) for managing parking reservations at office's lot. 

- Connects to web service.
- Handles push notifications.
- Uses event bus
- Implements calendar widget that I recently released as a flutter library -> https://github.com/adamstyrc/calendarro
